        <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong>  I’m Keiona Leaks. I’m originally from Jacksonville, NC. I moved to Charlotte when I was 15. I have a sweet little puppy and two fishes. I’m in love with the gym and painting. I’m extremely creative and artistic. I intend to reach all of my goals even if it hurts.</li> 
        <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong>  I’m still super young so I don’t have the greatest academic background. I graduated from Garinger High School in 2020. During this time, I learned multiple instruments and introduced myself to computers.</li> 
        <li><strong>Background in this subject:</strong>  I have lots of experience with photoshop. I forced myself to learn so I could convince people I had a twin. I also learned game design in high school. The library allowed me to check out multiple books on Web and Graphic Design.</li>
        <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong>  This new school Dell laptop, and an old Lenovo that shuts down when you look in its direction. </li>
        <li><strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong>
         <ul><li>CRO7000-01: CO 
        I want a better future for myself. I want the set of skills this course will teach me. I can create things on my own outside of work. It gives me a chance to artistically express myself in a way I haven’t before.</li>
