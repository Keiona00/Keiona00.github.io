    <h2>Contract</h2>
    <p>I, Keiona Leaks, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Semester 2022, CRO7000-01, 
        CO Programming with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
    </p>
    <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the 
        world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
    </p>
    <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, 
        failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
    </p>
    <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online 
        or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not 
        cut and paste code except where I havei have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my 
        classmates.
