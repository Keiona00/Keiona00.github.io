    <p>Hey, there! Come, settle in! I'm Keiona, I'm so glad you made it. I'll be sharing 
        a set of skills that I'm learning. I have a bunch of them actually. I like to learn 
        a bunch of new things and pull them out like party tricks. Like I trained two bunnies 
        to jump on my command. Crazy, right? I can also paint and create comic books. I hope 
        one day you're actually end up reading one of them. My dream once was to become an 
        animator, and create new shows for everyone to watch. I love being able to let my 
        unique style to shine in the light.</p>
