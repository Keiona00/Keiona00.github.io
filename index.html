<h2>Opening</h2>
<p>Welcome! Come, settle in! I'm Keiona, I'm so glad you made it. I'll be sharing a set of skills that I'm learning. I have a bunch of them actually. I like to learn a bunch of new things and pull them out like party tricks. Like I trained two bunnies to jump on my command. Crazy, right? I can also paint and create comic books. I hope one day you're actually end up reading one of them. My dream once was to become an animator, and create new shows for everyone to watch. I love being able to let my unique style to shine in the light.</p>
